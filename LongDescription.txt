Lucky/Unlucky Number

NEW:  Users can opt out of playing and just tip by putting the word 'optout'
      anywhere in their tip note.

NEW:  Tips greater than the highest remaining number available will get played
      against the highest remaining numbers automatically.  THESE ARE CONSIDERED
      SAFE NUMBERS (they will not be "unlucky").  For example if the numbers left
      are 1-20,24,25,26,27,28,29,30 and somebody tips 100 tokens, then the
      numbers 30, 29 & 28 will be removed from the board (the remaining number 13
      will NOT be auto played since it can't be certain it's safe at this time).

===============================

This is a variation on the classic "guess the number I'm thinking of" game with a 
few twists:

1.      If the unlucky number is guessed, the game starts over and all the numbers 
	reset.
2.      Both numbers are randomly picked and are kept secret - the broadcaster 
	finds out with everybody else what the numbers are.
3.      To partially compensate for the secretness (?) of the numbers, the unlucky 
	number will ALMOST always be lower than the lucky number.

With the unlucky number factor, token counts can go up dramatically.  The following 
are some results of one million run simulations (assuming no duplicate tips (which 
would only increase the average) and completely random tips):

Range/Average Income/Average w/o Unlucky #
1-10   39    30
1-20   145  110
5-15    9      59
5-20    140  106
10-20  119   89
10-30  291   219
20-30  198   149
20-40   439   329
30-50   584   440
1-100   3391 2551  (Good luck with this one!)

Best of Luck! And Enjoy!
