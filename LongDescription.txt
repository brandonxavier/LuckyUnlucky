Lucky/Unlucky Number

This is a variation on the classic "guess the number I'm thinking of" game with a 
few twists:

1.      If the unlucky number is guessed, the game starts over and all the numbers 
	reset.
2.      Both numbers are randomly picked and are kept secret - the broadcaster 
	finds out with everybody else what the numbers are.
3.      To partially compensate for the secretness (?) of the numbers, the unlucky 
	number will ALMOST always be lower than the lucky number.

With the unlucky number factor, token counts can go up dramatically.  The following 
are some results of one million run simulations (assuming no duplicate tips (which 
would only increase the average) and completely random tips):

Range/Average Income/Average w/o Unlucky #
1-10   39    30
1-20   145  110
5-15    9      59
5-20    140  106
10-20  119   89
10-30  291   219
20-30  198   149
20-40   439   329
30-50   584   440
1-100   3391 2551  (Good luck with this one!)

Best of Luck! And Enjoy!
